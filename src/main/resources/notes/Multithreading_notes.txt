🧩 1. What is a Thread?

👉 A thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a program.
Each Java program runs at least one main thread (the one that runs your main() method).

💡 You can think of:

Process = an independent running program (e.g., chrome.exe, java.exe)

Thread = a lightweight subprocess inside a process

Each process can have multiple threads sharing the same memory.

🧠 Example analogy:

Imagine a restaurant:

Process → The restaurant

Threads → The waiters inside the restaurant
All waiters (threads) work in parallel but share the same kitchen (memory).

🧩 2. Why Multithreading?

✅ Advantages:

Better CPU utilization (tasks run in parallel)

Better performance in I/O operations (e.g., file read + database call)

Used in real-world systems:

Web servers

Banking systems

Gaming / UI applications

❌ Disadvantages:

Complex debugging

Synchronization issues (data corruption if not managed properly)

Deadlocks, race conditions

🧩 3. Thread Lifecycle (Important for interviews)

A Java thread has several states (from Thread.State enum):

State	Meaning
NEW	Thread object created but start() not called
RUNNABLE	Thread ready to run or running
BLOCKED/WAITING	Waiting for lock or other thread
TERMINATED (DEAD)	Thread finished execution

Lifecycle looks like this:

NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → WAITING/BLOCKED → TERMINATED


Important Thread Methods (Interview Essentials)
| Method                    | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `start()`                 | Starts a new thread, internally calls `run()`  |
| `run()`                   | Code executed by the thread                    |
| `sleep(ms)`               | Pause thread for given time                    |
| `join()`                  | Waits for a thread to finish before continuing |
| `isAlive()`               | Checks if thread is still running              |
| `getName()` / `setName()` | Gets/sets thread name                          |
| `setPriority(int)`        | Sets priority (1–10, default=5)                |


Thread Scheduling & Priority (Quick Overview)

Java thread scheduler decides which thread runs next.

Priority range: Thread.MIN_PRIORITY (1) → Thread.MAX_PRIORITY (10)
Default = 5

Higher priority threads may get more CPU time, but not guaranteed (depends on OS).

t1.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
t2.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);


ThreadGroup (Basic Awareness)

A ThreadGroup is used to group multiple threads together for easier management. Rarely used now since ExecutorService replaced it.

Example:

ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("MyGroup");
Thread t1 = new Thread(group, new MyRunnable(), "T1");
Thread t2 = new Thread(group, new MyRunnable(), "T2");
