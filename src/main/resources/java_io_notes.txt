🔹 1. What is Java I/O?

I/O = Input/Output
It is a mechanism to perform data transfer — reading data (input) and writing data (output) between programs and external sources like files, network sockets, or memory.

Java I/O is based on the Stream concept — a continuous flow of data (like a pipeline).

🔹 2. Types of Streams
| Type                 | Description                                               | Data Type                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Byte Stream**      | For binary data like images, audio, video, or executables | 8-bit bytes               |
| **Character Stream** | For text data like text files, XML, JSON, etc.            | 16-bit Unicode characters |


🔹 3. BYTE STREAMS

Byte streams are built on two main abstract classes:

InputStream → For reading bytes

OutputStream → For writing bytes

You cannot use abstract classes directly; instead, you use their concrete subclasses.

🧩 InputStream (Abstract Class)

Package: java.io
Purpose: To read data (byte-by-byte) from a source.

🔸 Common Methods:
| Method                                 | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `int read()`                           | Reads one byte; returns -1 if end of file                 |
| `int read(byte[] b)`                   | Reads bytes into an array; returns number of bytes read   |
| `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` | Reads up to `len` bytes into `b` starting at offset `off` |
| `void close()`                         | Closes the stream and releases system resources           |
| `int available()`                      | Returns number of bytes that can be read without blocking |
| `long skip(long n)`                    | Skips n bytes of input                                    |


🧩 OutputStream (Abstract Class)

| `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)` | Writes specific bytes from array                         |
| `void flush()`                           | Forces data to be written to the destination immediately |
| `void close()`                           | Closes the stream                                        |

🔹 6. MNC-Level Interview Notes 🧠

✅ Concept Questions:

Difference between Byte Stream and Character Stream

What does flush() do?

Why are InputStream and OutputStream abstract?

What is buffering and why is it needed?

What is the difference between FileWriter and BufferedWriter?

How does InputStreamReader act as a bridge between byte and character streams?

What’s the difference between PrintStream and PrintWriter?

✅ Practical Question:

Write a program to copy the content of one file into another using both Byte and Character Streams.

How will you handle encoding (UTF-8 vs ISO-8859-1) while reading a file?
